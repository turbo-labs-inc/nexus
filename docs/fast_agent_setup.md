# Fast-Agent Integration Setup

This document outlines how to set up and test the Fast-Agent Bridge in the Nexus application.

## Overview

The Fast-Agent Bridge provides communication between the Next.js frontend and a Python-based Fast-Agent server. It enables:

- Real-time messaging via WebSockets
- Multimodal content processing
- Tool integrations
- Streaming responses and thinking indicators

## Architecture

The implementation follows a layered approach:

1. **Bridge Layer**: Core WebSocket communication with the Python server
2. **Hook Layer**: React hooks for integrating the bridge with UI components
3. **Component Layer**: React components for displaying and interacting with Fast-Agent

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Python Environment Setup

First, set up the Python environment for the Fast-Agent server:

```bash
# Navigate to the Fast-Agent directory
cd fast_agent

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the Fast-Agent Server

With the Python environment activated, start the test server:

```bash
python server.py
```

The server will start on http://localhost:8000 with the WebSocket endpoint at ws://localhost:8000/ws/{client_id}.

### 3. Test the Connection

You can use the included test client to verify the server is working correctly:

```bash
python test_client.py
```

This will send various message types to the server and display the responses.

### 4. Access the Demo Page

With the server running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3131/fast-agent-demo
```

This demo page showcases the Fast-Agent integration with a simple chat interface.

## Implementation Details

### WebSocket Protocol

The Fast-Agent Bridge communicates with the Python server using a defined message protocol:

- **Message Types**: Standardized message types for all communications
- **Data Format**: JSON-based message structure
- **Error Handling**: Protocol-level error detection and recovery
- **Connection Management**: Connection establishment, monitoring, and recovery

### Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Bidirectional WebSocket messaging
- **Message History**: Persistent message history
- **Thinking Indicators**: Visual feedback during processing
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection on disconnection
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces

## Testing

The implementation follows a test-driven approach with:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test the bridge with a real (or mock) server
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test the complete flow from UI to server and back

## Next Steps

1. Enhance the Fast-Agent server with actual AI capabilities
2. Implement tool registration and execution
3. Add support for multimodal content (images, files)
4. Create more sophisticated UI components
5. Integrate with the MCP orchestration system
