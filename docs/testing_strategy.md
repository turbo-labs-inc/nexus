# Nexus Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Nexus project, focusing on ensuring high-quality code with comprehensive test coverage.

## Testing Tools

The Nexus project uses the following testing tools:

- **Jest**: For unit and integration tests
- **React Testing Library**: For component testing
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end tests

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual functions, components, or modules in isolation. They should be:

- Fast to run
- Independent of each other
- Cover edge cases and error handling
- Mock external dependencies

Key areas for unit testing:
- UI components
- Utility functions
- Hooks
- Context providers
- API clients

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work correctly together. They should focus on:

- Component compositions
- Data flow between components
- Context integration
- API integration

### End-to-End Tests

E2E tests simulate user interaction with the application and verify that the application works as expected from the user's perspective. These tests should:

- Cover critical user flows
- Test the entire application stack
- Verify that all parts of the application work together correctly

## Test Coverage

We aim for the following test coverage:

- **Unit tests**: At least 70% code coverage
- **Integration tests**: Cover all critical paths and component interactions
- **E2E tests**: Cover all main user flows

## Directory Structure

Tests are organized as follows:

- `src/**/tests/` or `src/**/__tests__/`: Unit and integration tests
- `cypress/e2e/`: End-to-end tests
- `cypress/support/`: Cypress utility functions and commands

## Testing Workflow Designer

The workflow designer is a critical component of the Nexus project, allowing users to build and manage orchestration workflows. Testing for this component includes:

### Unit Tests
- Testing individual node components
- Testing node configuration dialogs
- Testing workflow designer interactions (undo/redo, save, execute)

### Integration Tests
- Testing node connections
- Testing workflow execution
- Testing workflow saving and loading

### End-to-End Tests
- Testing the complete workflow creation process
- Testing workflow execution from start to finish
- Testing interaction between different node types

## Running Tests

- **Unit Tests**: `npm test` or `npm run test:watch` for development
- **Coverage Report**: `npm run test:coverage`
- **E2E Tests**: `npm run cypress` or `npm run cypress:headless` for CI
- **Full E2E with Server**: `npm run e2e` or `npm run e2e:headless`

## Continuous Integration

The test suite should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that all tests pass before code is merged or deployed. The pipeline should:

1. Run linting checks (`npm run lint`)
2. Run type checking (`npm run typecheck`)
3. Run unit and integration tests (`npm test`)
4. Run end-to-end tests (`npm run cypress:headless`)

## Best Practices

- Write tests before or alongside code (TDD or BDD)
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Avoid testing implementation details, focus on behavior
- Use data-testid attributes for E2E tests to avoid coupling tests to implementation
- Mock external dependencies
- Regularly review and update tests as the application evolves

## Next Steps

1. Implement unit tests for all new components
2. Add integration tests for workflow execution
3. Create E2E tests for critical user flows
4. Set up CI/CD to run the test suite
5. Establish code coverage requirements for PRs
