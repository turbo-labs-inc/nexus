# Fixes for Nexus Development Environment

## Issue: App Spinning Indefinitely with `npm run dev`

The primary issue was in the middleware which was causing infinite loops or hanging when environment variables were missing or authentication setup wasn't complete. This was especially problematic when running Cypress tests.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Middleware Improvements
- Made the middleware more resilient by checking for required environment variables
- Removed excessive console logs that could slow down the app
- Added early exit paths when environment variables are missing
- Simplified error handling to prevent spinning
- Added special bypass for Cypress test mode

### 2. Safe Development Mode
- Created a new `dev:safe` script that ensures proper environment setup
- Updated Cypress test scripts to use this safer mode
- Added automatic environment variable checks and fallbacks
- Fixed experimental flags in Cypress config that were causing issues

### 3. Custom Cypress Runner
- Created a dedicated Cypress runner script that properly coordinates the dev server and Cypress
- Automatically checks if the server is running before starting tests
- Supports both interactive and headless modes
- Handles process termination cleanly

### 4. Documentation
- Updated README with troubleshooting section
- Added clear instructions for using the safe development mode
- Fixed port reference in documentation (changed from 3000 to 3131)

## How to Use

### For Normal Development
When you encounter infinite spinning:

```bash
npm run dev:safe
```

This will:
1. Check for required environment variables
2. Create them with sensible defaults if missing
3. Start the Next.js development server with additional safeguards

### For Running Cypress Tests
Use the new runner:

```bash
# Interactive mode
npm run e2e

# Headless mode
npm run e2e:headless
```

The runner script will:
1. Start the Next.js server with special settings for Cypress
2. Verify the server is running before launching Cypress
3. Run tests in your preferred mode
4. Clean up processes when done

## Technical Details

The primary issues fixed were:

1. Middleware authentication checks that failed silently but continuously
2. Missing environment variable handling
3. Excessive logging and JSON parsing that could slow down responses
4. Cookie-based authentication that could cause infinite loops
5. Experimental flags in Cypress that are no longer supported
6. Race conditions between the dev server and Cypress

The new implementation gracefully handles these edge cases while maintaining the same functionality for production use.
