# Nexus Implementation Plan

## Key Questions Before We Begin

1. **Hosting Environment**: Where will the application be deployed? (Vercel, self-hosted, etc.)
   a. probz Vercel - but leveraging strong PWA features is important.
2. **Authentication Requirements**: Will we need social logins (Google, GitHub) or just email/password?
   Social logins important - Google most impoartant.
3. **Data Storage**: Any specific Supabase table schema requirements or preferences?
   Not really - security is important. user scopes and permissions is important. users have companies + teams and those teams having projects is important.
4. **API Keys**: Do you have all required API keys for MCP servers (beyond those in mcp.json)?
   you bet.
5. **Python Environment**: Any preferences for Python version and package management (pip, conda, poetry)?
   pip, whatever my computer has for python version
6. **UI/UX Design**: Do you have any design mockups or color scheme preferences?
   Just make it really clean and modern. But do not make it basic. Style the whole system in a modern way, and then shadcn will really shine. When questioning 'how something should look' you should deep research with brave to find killer examples. I would prefer for it to have 'fire' / lava style color pallete, but if we can get a little purple in the gradient, awesome. . you can search brave for a color pallete if need be.
7. **Target Browsers/Devices**: Any specific browser or device compatibility requirements?
   PWA
8. **Testing Strategy**: Preferred testing framework (Jest, Playwright, Cypress)?
   cypress is the end goal - but unit tests for the basics is super important too.
9. **Internationalization**: Do we need to support multiple languages?
   not yet.
10. **Fast-Agent Specifics**: Any existing Fast-Agent templates or configurations to use?
    No. you will need to braveresearch a lot of that. The key thing is i want the fast agent server to be headless eventually. I want the mcp ecosystem to be modular. So that users can configure them as plugins, they can save off repeated 'chains' and run them. and eventually we can expose the server to something like slack - but as always - the user chatting with it only has certain access to certain things. probably each user has their own 'mcp config' so that they can't hit something they don't have api access for.
11. A key note here - i also want to do voice chat.
